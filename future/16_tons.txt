Some people say a man is made outta mud
a poor man's made outta muscle and blood
muscle and blood and skin and bones
a mind that's a-weak and a back that's strong

you load sixteen tons, what do you get?
another day older and deeper in debt
saint peter don't you call me 'cause i can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and i walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
and the straw boss said "well, a-bless my soul"

you load sixteen tons, what do you get?
another day older and deeper in debt
saint peter don't you call me 'cause i can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one mornin', it was drizzlin' rain
fightin' and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the canebrake* by an ol' mama lion
cain't no-a high-toned woman make me walk the line

you load sixteen tons, what do you get?
another day older and deeper in debt
saint peter don't you call me 'cause i can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

If you see me comin', better step aside
a lotta men didn't, a lotta men died
one fist of iron, the other of steel
if the right one don't a-get you, then the left one will

you load sixteen tons, what do you get?
another day older and deeper in debt
saint peter don't you call me 'cause i can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
