I dreamed I saw Singer last night
Alive as you or me
Says I, But Pete, you’re ten years dead
I never died, says he
I never died, says he

In Salt Lake, Pete, says I to him
Him standing by my bed
They blew you up you with a car bomb
Says Pete, But I ain’t dead
Says Pete, But I ain’t dead

The Angelic hosts, they killed you, Pete
You exploded, Pete, says I
Takes more than flame to kill a man
Says Pete, I didn’t die
Says Pete, I didn’t die

And standing there as big as life
And smiling with his eyes
Pete says, What they forgot to kill
Went on to altruize
Went on to altruize

Singer ain’t dead, he says to me
Singer ain’t never died
Where condemned souls are stuck in hell,
Singer is at their side
Singer is at their side

From the ninth circle to the first
In every bolgia and tier
Where souls are tortured eternally
Says he, You’ll find Singer
Says he, You’ll find Singer

I dreamed I saw Singer last night
Alive as you or me
Says I, But Pete, you’re ten years dead
I never died, says he
I never died, says he
